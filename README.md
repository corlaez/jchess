# jchess

Simple Java Chess game API.

## About this project

The goal is to provide a simple, easy-to-use API to manipulate chess games in Java.
It is also easy to extend in order to create extended chess rules, new pieces and so on.

This project does **NOT** provide any chess engine for position analysis. However, it could
be very easily used by another API to do such task.

This API is compiled with the JDK 11.

The main features of this API are:
- Ease of use
- Standard chess rules
- Algebraic notation
- Custom positions
- PGN import
- PGN export
- Game metadata
- ASCII rendering

## Installation (maven)

Use the following dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>ch.astorm</groupId>
    <artifactId>jchess</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Quick Start Guide

A standard chess game can be very easily created:

```java
//new chess game with standard board and rules
JChessGame game = JChessGame.newGame();

//apply the move to the game
game.play("e4");

//cancel the last move
game.back();

//moves can be played altogether
game.play("e4","e5","Nf3","Nc6","Bb5","a6","Ba4","Nf6","O-O","Be7",
          "Re1","b5","Bb3","d6","c3","O-O","h3","Nb8","d4","Nbd7",
          "c4","c6","cxb5","axb5","Nc3","Bb7","Bg5","b4","Nb1","h6",
          "Bh4","c5","dxe5","Nxe4","Bxe7","Qxe7","exd6","Qf6","Nbd2","Nxd6",
          "Nc4","Nxc4","Bxc4","Nb6","Ne5","Rae8","Bxf7+","Rxf7","Nxf7","Rxe1+",
          "Qxe1","Kxf7","Qe3","Qg5","Qxg5","hxg5","b3","Ke6","a3","Kd6",
          "axb4","cxb4","Ra5","Nd5","f3","Bc8","Kf2","Bf5","Ra7","g6",
          "Ra6+","Kc5","Ke1","Nf4","g3","Nxh3","Kd2","Kb5","Rd6","Kc5",
          "Ra6","Nf2","g4","Bd3","Re6");

//agree to a draw
game.draw();

//prints the final position
ASCIIPositionRenderer.render(System.out, game.getPosition());
```

## Usage

Here are some usages about specific parts of the API.

The main entry point is the [JChessGame](src/main/java/ch/astorm/jchess/JChessGame.java) class
that will handle the global game.

### Game initialization

The creation of a new game is straightforward:

```java
JChessGame game = JChessGame.newGame();
```

Once the game is created, it has already the standard chess rules and the initial
position built in. Hence, the game is ready and White have the move.

### Query the position

The current [Position](src/main/java/ch/astorm/jchess/core/Position.java) of a game can be explored
with various methods.

```
Position position = game.getPosition();

//get the positions of all the moveable entities in the position
Map<Coordinate, Moveable> moveables = position.getMoveables();

//get all the white entities in the position
List<Moveable> whiteMoveables = position.getMoveables(Color.WHITE);

//find the location of the white's king
Coordinate kingLocation = position.findLocation(King.class, Color.WHITE);

//get the moveable entity in b1
Moveable moveableAtLocation = position.get("b1");

//set the moveable entity in e5
position.put("e5", new Rook(Color.BLACK));
```

### Start from a custom position

In some cases, one may want to set a custom position to start.

```java
JChessGame game = JChessGame.newEmptyGame(Color.WHITE);
game.put("a1", new King(Color.WHITE));
game.put("h8", new King(Color.BLACK));
```

The example below creates a new game with only the two kings and White has the move.

It is possible to put some position without any king on the board. If there is no
king, then the status of the game will remain `Status.NOT_FINISHED`.

Note that it is not possible to put multiple kings of the same color on the board.

### Position's legal moves

It is very easy to retrieves all the legal moves in a position for the color
that has the move:

```java
List<Move> legalMoves = game.getAvailableMoves();
```

If the position is known, the API allows to get the legal moves from a given location:

```java
List<Move> legalMoves = game.getAvailableMoves("c3");
```

It is also possible to retrieves the legal moves for a given entity:

```java
Position position = game.getPosition();
Coordinate kingCoordinate = position.findLocation(King.class, Color.WHITE);
Moveable king = position.get(kingCoordinate);
List<Move> kingMoves = game.getAvailableMoves(king);
```

### Color on move

The method `getColorOnMove()` can be used to know which color has the move. It is also possible
to change the current color on move:

```java
JChessGame game = JChessGame.newGame();
game.switchColorOnMove();

//black has the move
game.play("e5");
```

### Play moves

To play the moves in the game, it is recommanded to use directly the `JChessGame` because
they read the [algebraic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess))
to update the position.

```java
JChessGame game = JChessGame.newGame();
game.play("e4"); //white plays e4
game.play("e5"); //black plays e5

//moves can be grouped together and they will be played in alternance
game.play("Nc3","e6");
```

Each move will update the current position and automatically switch the `Color` being on the move.
It is possible to go back in the moves by using the `game.back()` methods.

```java
Move lastMove = game.back(); //drop the last move
List<Move> lastMoves = game.back(3); //drop the last 3 moves (if possible)
```

You may want to access a possible move in the position without actually playing it:

```java
Move move1 = game.getMove("Nxd4");
Move move2 = game.getMove("d8=Q");
```

### Game status

After each move, one can retrieve the game status that can be one of the following values:

 Status | Description | Continue |
 ------ | ----------- | -------------- |
 `NOT_FINISHED` | The game is not finished. | Yes |
 `WIN_WHITE` | The whites have won. | *No* |
 `WIN_BLACK` | The blacks have won. | *No* |
 `DRAW` | The game is draw either by agreement (see `JChessGame.draw()`) or by insufficiant material. | Yes |
 `DRAW_STALEMATE` | The game is a draw by stalemate. One of the player has no legal move that does not put his king in check. | *No* |
 `DRAW_REPETITION` | The game is a draw by repeating the same position 5 times. | *No* |
 `DRAW_NOCAPTURE` | The game is a draw by playing 75 moves without any capture nor pawn move. | *No* |

It is possible to continue to play even if the status is `DRAW` because it is generally not enforced to stop
(see [dead positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Dead_position)).

The status can simply be retrieved after any move with the code below:

```java
Status status = game.getStatus();
```

### Import games from PGN files

It is possible to import basic [PGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) files
as `JChessGame`. Note that the API does not support extended PGN with remarks and deviations.

```java
try(PGNReader pgnReader = new PGNReader(/* reader */) {
    JChessGame game = pgnReader.readGame();
    while(game!=null) {
        /* handle game */
        
        //read next game, if any
        game = pgnReader.readGame();
    }
}
```

Note: the PGN format uses `ISO-8859-1` encoding.

### Export games to PGN files

Once a `JChessGame` has been created, the PGN export is straightforward and can
export multiple games.

```java
try(PGNWriter pgnWriter = new PGNWriter(/* writer */)) {
    pgnWriter.write(game1);
    pgnWriter.write(game2);
    pgnWriter.write(game3);
}
```

### Game Metadata

The PGN parser supports metadata. This is simply a list of key/value pairs that are stored
during the parsing of the file.

```
JChessGame game = pgnReader.readGame();

Map<String,String> metadata = game.getMetadata();
String result = metadata.get("Result");
```

### Printing a position

Mainly for debug purposes, jchess provides a simple API to print a position in CLI:

#### Unicode

The unicode renderer's output is compact but does not support showing which cells are dark or light when they are not empty.

```java
JChessGame game = JChessGame.newGame();
UnicodePositionRenderer.render(System.out, game.getPosition());
```

![image](/unicode.PNG)

#### ASCII

```java
JChessGame game = JChessGame.newGame();
ASCIIPositionRenderer.render(System.out, game.getPosition());
```

The result will look like this:

```

The [ASCIIPositionRenderer](src/main/java/ch/astorm/jchess/util/ASCIIPositionRenderer.java) class can
be used to render different styles in ASCII.

## Compilation

The standard maven command applies. However, since the tests are time-consuming, you might
want to skip them.

```
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```
